# Visualizing external trace formats with Perfetto

Perfetto is capable of opening and analyzing trace files generated by a variety
of external tools and systems, not just its own native protobuf format. You
might have existing traces in these formats if:

- You're already using other tracing tools and have accumulated data.
- Perfetto's recording capabilities aren't the primary fit for your data
  collection needs, but you wish to use its analysis tools.
- You have custom timestamped data which you can convert this into one of the
  external formats Perfetto understands (detailed below).
  - Alternatively, you might consider converting your data directly into
    Perfetto's
    [native TrackEvent protobuf format](/docs/reference/synthetic-track-event.md),
    which can offer more power and flexibility.

The main advantages of using Perfetto to examine these external traces are its
powerful analysis and visualization capabilities:

- **The Perfetto UI:** A versatile, web-based trace viewer designed to handle
  large and complex timeline data, offering rich interactive analysis.
- **Trace Processor:** A powerful SQL-based engine that allows for programmatic
  querying and in-depth analysis of timestamped data from these diverse formats.

Below, we detail the supported formats, provide context on their typical use
cases, and outline what to expect when loading them into Perfetto.

## Chrome JSON format

**Description:** The Chrome JSON trace format consists of a JSON array of event
objects. Each object represents a single trace event and typically includes
fields like `pid` (process ID), `tid` (thread ID), `ts` (timestamp in
microseconds), `ph` (phase, indicating event type like begin, end, instant,
counter, etc.), `name` (event name), `cat` (category), and `args`
(event-specific arguments). This format was originally developed for Chrome's
`about:tracing` (now `chrome://tracing`) tool.

**Common Scenarios:** While Chromium browser developers now primarily use
Perfetto's native protobuf format for trace collection, the Chrome JSON format
is still encountered in several situations:

- **Third-party Tools & Libraries:** Due to its longevity and relatively simple
  structure, many external tools, custom C++ instrumentation libraries, and
  libraries in other languages (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java) adopted the Chrome
  JSON format for emitting trace data. It's often chosen for its ease of
  generation and established "stability" as a known format.
- **Export from Chrome DevTools:** The "Performance" panel in modern Chrome
  DevTools can still export profiles in this JSON format.
- **Legacy Traces:** You might have older traces from Chrome that are in this
  format.

**Perfetto Support:**

- **Perfetto UI:** Chrome JSON files can be opened directly in the Perfetto UI.
  The UI visualizes common event types, including:
  - `B` (begin) and `E` (end) events as slices.
  - `X` (complete) events as slices.
  - `I` (instant) events as single points on the timeline.
  - `C` (counter) events as counter tracks.
  - `M` (metadata) events for process and thread names, etc.
  - `s`, `t`, `f` (flow) events as connecting arrows between slices.
- **Trace Processor:** These events are parsed into Perfetto's standard SQL
  tables (e.g., `slice`, `track`, `process`, `thread`, `counter`, `args`). This
  allows you to analyze Chrome JSON traces using SQL queries.
- **Important Notes:**
  - Perfetto aims to adhere to the
    [Trace Event Format specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview).
    It does not attempt to replicate specific rendering quirks or undocumented
    behaviors of the legacy `chrome://tracing` tool unless they are critical for
    basic trace understanding.
  - Perfetto enforces strict nesting for duration events (`B` and `E` pairs).
    Overlapping, non-nested events might not be visualized or processed as they
    are in the legacy `chrome://tracing` viewer, which could be more lenient.
    For more details, see the
    [FAQ on overlapping JSON events](/docs/faq.md#why-are-overlapping-events-in-json-traces-not-displayed-correctly).
  - Support for some less common or highly specific features of the JSON format
    might be limited. Refer to the
    [FAQ on obscure JSON features](/docs/faq.md#why-does-perfetto-not-support-some-obscure-json-format-feature).

**How to Generate:**

- **Programmatically by External Tools & Libraries:** This is the most common
  way this format is generated today. Due to its established nature and simple
  structure, various libraries and tools across different languages (e.g., for
  Node.js, Python, Java, C++) can produce trace files in the Chrome JSON format.
- **Export from Chrome DevTools:** The "Performance" panel in Chromium-based
  browsers allows you to record activity and then use the "Save profile..."
  (download) option to get a JSON file.
- **Historically from `chrome://tracing`:** Older versions of Chrome used this
  interface for saving traces.

## Android systrace format

**Description:** Android Systrace was the **legacy** system-wide tracing tool
for Android, used primarily before the introduction of Perfetto with Android 9
(Pie). It captures kernel activity via `ftrace` (e.g., CPU scheduling, I/O) and
userspace annotations via ATrace (e.g., `android.os.Trace`). Systrace typically
produces an interactive HTML file embedding trace data in a text-based format.

**Common Scenarios (Primarily Legacy):** You will typically only encounter the
Android Systrace format when dealing with **older data or legacy workflows**,
such as:

- Analyzing traces generated on Android systems prior to Android 9 (Pie).
- Working with historical traces recorded using the `systrace.py` command-line
  tool.
- Examining traces from very old versions of Android Studio's profiler.

**For any current or new tracing on Android (version 9 Pie and newer), Perfetto
is the standard and strongly recommended tool.**

**Perfetto Support:**

- **Perfetto UI:** Perfetto can directly open Android Systrace HTML files,
  parsing the embedded ftrace and ATrace data for visualization. This is
  primarily for compatibility with historical traces.
- **Trace Processor:** The Trace Processor also supports parsing the raw textual
  ftrace data found within Systrace reports. This data is imported into standard
  Perfetto SQL tables (e.g., `slice`, `sched_slice`, `ftrace_event`), making it
  queryable via SQL.
- **Important Note:** Perfetto's support for Systrace is for **backward
  compatibility.** Systrace is a deprecated tool for trace collection on modern
  Android (Android 9 Pie and newer). Perfetto has superseded it, offering
  significantly more data sources, lower overhead, and more advanced analysis
  capabilities. **New tracing efforts should exclusively use Perfetto.**

**How to Generate (Legacy Methods):** The methods below describe how Systrace
files were historically created and are provided for context when dealing with
older traces. **These methods are deprecated and should not be used for new
trace collection on Android 9 (Pie) or newer.**

- **Using `systrace.py` (Deprecated):** Historically, these traces were
  generated using the `systrace.py` script from the Android SDK Platform Tools.
  An example command might look like:
  ```bash
  # python <sdk>/platform-tools/systrace/systrace.py -a <your.app.package.name> -o mytrace.html sched freq idle am wm
  ```
- **Android Studio (Older Versions - Deprecated):** Earlier versions of Android
  Studio's profiler used Systrace. Modern Android Studio now uses Perfetto.

## Linux ftrace textual format

**Description:** The Linux ftrace textual format is the raw, human-readable
output generated by the Linux kernel's `ftrace` tracing infrastructure. Each
line in this text-based format typically represents a single trace event and
follows a common structure:
`TASK-PID CPU# [MARKERS] TIMESTAMP FUNCTION --- ARGS`. For example, a
`sched_switch` event might look like:
`bash-1234 [002] ...1 5075.958079: sched_switch: prev_comm=bash prev_pid=1234 prev_prio=120 prev_state=R ==> next_comm=trace-cmd next_pid=5678 next_prio=120`.
This format can be quite verbose but is fundamental to how ftrace operates and
is exposed via the `tracefs` filesystem (usually mounted at
`/sys/kernel/tracing`).

**Common Scenarios:** You are likely to encounter or use this format when:

- Analyzing ftrace data captured using the `trace-cmd` utility, specifically
  with commands like `trace-cmd report` or `trace-cmd stream`.
- Directly reading from ftrace buffer files in `tracefs`, such as
  `/sys/kernel/tracing/trace`.
- Working with older Linux kernel debugging workflows or custom scripts that
  produce this textual output.
- Inspecting the raw data embedded within Android Systrace HTML files, as they
  use this underlying format.

**Perfetto Support:** Perfetto's support for the ftrace textual format is
primarily for **legacy compatibility and is maintained on a best-effort basis.**

- **Perfetto UI:** The Perfetto UI can directly open ftrace textual log files
  (often with `.txt` or `.ftrace` extensions). It visualizes known event types
  by parsing the text lines. For instance:
  - `sched_switch` events are displayed as scheduling slices on CPU tracks.
  - `print` events that match the ATrace format are shown as userspace slices.
  - Other ftrace events present in the text file might not be visualized if they
    don't map to recognized Perfetto UI elements.
- **Trace Processor:** When parsing ftrace textual logs, Perfetto's Trace
  Processor will:
  - Parse recognized events (e.g., `sched_switch`, `sched_waking`,
    `cpu_frequency`, atrace-compatible `print` events) into their corresponding
    structured SQL tables (e.g., `sched_slice`, `slice`, `counter`).
  - **Unlike Perfetto's native ftrace protobuf ingestion, unrecognized or
    generic ftrace events from a textual ftrace file are generally not populated
    into a broad `ftrace_event` catch-all table.** Support is typically limited
    to events that have specific parsers for creating structured tables.
- **Recommendation:** For new tracing activities on systems where Perfetto is
  available (especially Android 9+ or Linux systems with Perfetto installed),
  **using Perfetto's native ftrace data source is strongly recommended.**
  Perfetto's direct collection records ftrace data into its own efficient binary
  protobuf format, offering better performance, richer features (including
  parsing of generic ftrace events into the protobuf `GenericFtraceEvent` type),
  and more robust support. Importing the textual format should be reserved for
  analyzing pre-existing logs.

**How to Generate (for context on existing logs):** These methods describe how
ftrace textual logs are typically created using `tracefs` (usually mounted at
`/sys/kernel/tracing`). **For new tracing, prefer using Perfetto's ftrace data
source directly.**

- **Using `trace-cmd`:** `trace-cmd` is a user-space frontend for ftrace.

  ```bash
  # Example: Record scheduling and syscall events
  sudo trace-cmd record -e sched -e syscalls
  # After stopping (Ctrl-C or by duration), generate the textual report:
  trace-cmd report > my_ftrace_log.txt
  ```

  Or for a live stream:

  ```bash
  sudo trace-cmd stream -e sched:sched_waking -e irq:irq_handler_entry > my_ftrace_log.txt
  ```

  (Stop with Ctrl-C). Refer to `man trace-cmd` for more options.

- **Directly from `tracefs` (more manual):** You can interact with ftrace via
  the `/sys/kernel/tracing/` interface.
  ```bash
  # Example: Enable sched_switch and printk events
  sudo sh -c 'echo sched:sched_switch print > /sys/kernel/tracing/set_event'
  # Enable tracing
  sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/tracing_on'
  # ... allow the system to run or perform actions you want to trace ...
  # Capture the trace buffer
  sudo cat /sys/kernel/tracing/trace > my_ftrace_log.txt
  # Disable tracing and clear events
  sudo sh -c 'echo 0 > /sys/kernel/tracing/tracing_on'
  sudo sh -c 'echo > /sys/kernel/tracing/set_event'   # Clear events
  ```

## ART method tracing format

**Description:** The Android Runtime (ART) method tracing format (commonly found
in `.trace` files) is a binary format specific to Android. It captures detailed
information about the execution of Java and Kotlin methods within an Android
application, essentially logging the entry and exit points of each called
method. This allows for a fine-grained analysis of an app's runtime behavior at
the method level.

**Common Scenarios:** This format is typically used when:

- Needing to deeply profile the performance of specific Java or Kotlin code
  paths in an Android app to identify performance bottlenecks or understand
  complex call sequences.
- Analyzing traces generated by Android Studio's CPU Profiler, specifically when
  using the "Trace Java Methods" recording configuration.
- Working with traces created programmatically from within an application using
  the `android.os.Debug.startMethodTracing()` API.

**Perfetto Support:**

- **Perfetto UI:** `.trace` files can be opened directly in the Perfetto UI. The
  method calls are typically visualized as a flamegraph, providing an intuitive
  way to see where time is spent. They are also be displayed as nested slices on
  the timeline for each thread.
- **Trace Processor:** Perfetto's Trace Processor has built-in support for
  parsing ART method trace files (`.trace`).
  - Each method invocation (entry and exit) is imported as a distinct slice into
    the `slice` table. These slices are associated with their respective threads
    and processes.
  - This enables detailed SQL-based analysis of method execution times, call
    counts, stack depth, and relationships between different methods.
- **Important Note on Overhead:** ART method tracing, by its nature of
  instrumenting every method call, can introduce significant performance
  overhead to the application being profiled. This overhead might alter the very
  behavior you are trying to measure. For less intrusive CPU profiling of
  Java/Kotlin code, consider using Android Studio's "Sample Java Methods" option
  or Perfetto's system-wide callstack sampling capabilities, though these
  provide statistical data rather than an exact log of all method calls.

**How to Generate:**

- **Android Studio CPU Profiler:**
  1.  Open the Android Studio Profiler (View > Tool Windows > Profiler).
  2.  Select your device and the application process you want to profile.
  3.  In the CPU profiler section, choose the "Trace Java Methods" recording
      configuration from the dropdown menu.
  4.  Click "Record," perform the actions in your app that you want to profile,
      and then click "Stop."
  5.  The collected `.trace` file can then be exported from the Android Studio
      profiler interface for use in Perfetto.
- **Programmatically within an app:** You can instrument your app's Java/Kotlin
  code to start and stop method tracing using the `android.os.Debug` class:

  ```java
  import android.os.Debug;
  // ...
  // In your application code:
  // To start tracing:
  // Debug.startMethodTracing("myAppTraceName");
  // The .trace file will typically be saved to a location like:
  // /sdcard/Android/data/<your_app_package_name>/files/myAppTraceName.trace
  // or /data/data/<your_app_package_name>/files/myAppTraceName.trace depending on Android version and permissions.

  // ... execute the code you want to profile ...

  // To stop tracing:
  // Debug.stopMethodTracing();
  ```

  After stopping, you'll need to pull the generated `.trace` file from the
  device using ADB (e.g.,
  `adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/<your_app_package_name>/files/myAppTraceName.trace .`).
  The exact path can vary, so check your app's specific file storage location.

## Firefox Profiler JSON format

**Description:** The Firefox Profiler JSON format is primarily known for its use
by the [Firefox Profiler](https://profiler.firefox.com/), a web-based tool for
performance analysis. While the format can describe various types of timeline
data including "markers" (similar to trace events), its main strength, and
Perfetto's primary interest in it, lies in representing **CPU profiling data**,
especially sampled call stacks. This makes it an excellent target format for
visualizing flamegraphs and call trees from various profiling sources.

**Common Scenarios:** The most common reason Perfetto users encounter this
format is for:

- **Visualizing Linux `perf` (or Android `simpleperf`) CPU profiles:**
  Developers often collect CPU samples using `perf record` on Linux or
  `simpleperf` on Android. These native profiles can then be converted into the
  Firefox Profiler JSON format to leverage the interactive and user-friendly
  visualizations offered by tools like `profiler.firefox.com` or, as relevant
  here, for import into Perfetto.
- **Using cross-platform profiling tools:** Some profiling tools and libraries
  are designed to output or convert their data into this format, facilitating
  analysis with the Firefox Profiler UI.
- **Analyzing profiles from Firefox:** Less commonly for Perfetto users, one
  might have profiles captured directly within the Firefox browser itself.

**Perfetto Support:**

- **Perfetto UI & Trace Processor:** Perfetto provides _partial support_ for the
  Firefox Profiler JSON format, with a strong focus on **CPU sample data**.
  - When you open a Firefox Profiler JSON file, Perfetto attempts to parse call
    stacks, sample timestamps, and thread/process information.
  - This data is imported into standard Perfetto SQL tables like `perf_sample`,
    `stack_profile_callsite`, `stack_profile_frame`, and
    `stack_profile_mapping`.
  - In the Perfetto UI, this allows for the visualization of CPU profiles as
    flamegraphs.
- **Limitations:**
  - Support for Firefox Profiler "markers" (timeline events like slices or
    instants) is generally **not available** in Perfetto.
  - Other advanced features specific to the Firefox Profiler's internal data
    representation or UI hints (like custom track colors or rich
    browser-specific metadata) are typically not imported.
  - **The primary expectation when loading this format into Perfetto should be
    to analyze CPU callstack samples.**

**How to Generate:** The most relevant generation path for Perfetto users
involves converting native CPU profiles from Linux `perf` or Android
`simpleperf`.

<?tabs>

TAB: <code>perf</code> profiles on Linux

1.  **Record a profile with `perf record`:** Capture CPU samples
    for a specific command/process or  system-wide, generating a `perf.data` file.

    ```bash
    # Example: Profile at 99Hz for 1 seconds with DWARF call graphs
    sudo perf record -F 99 -g --call-graph dwarf --output perf.data --  find ~ -name 'foo'
    ```

    Refer to `man perf-record` for detailed command options. Ensure debug
    symbols for your binaries are accessible for proper symbolization.

2.  **Convert `perf.data` to Firefox Profiler JSON:** Use the `gecko` report
    script with `perf script`.

    ```bash
    sudo perf script report gecko --save-only my_linux_profile.json
    ```

    This command processes the `perf.data` file and outputs `my_linux_profile.json` in a
    format compatible with the Firefox Profiler. If `report gecko` is not available
    in your `perf` version, consult your distribution's documentation for
    alternatives or additional `perf` scripting packages.

3. **Open this trace in ui.perfetto.dev**

    Navigate to [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev) and upload the `my_linux_profile.json`
    file into the UI. Once the trace opens, you should be able select either individual
    CPU samples or ranges of time containing CPU samples to get a flamegraph of all
    the samples in that region.

    Here's an example of what that looks like

    ![](/docs/images/perf-profile-in-ui.png)

TAB: <code>simpleperf</code> profiles on Android

On Android, `simpleperf` is used for CPU profiling. The necessary Python scripts
(`app_profiler.py`, `gecko_profile_generator.py`) can be obtained by cloning
them directly from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).

1.  **Clone the `simpleperf` scripts from AOSP:** This command performs a
    shallow clone of the `platform/system/extras` repository, which contains
    `simpleperf` and its scripts. This helps to minimize the download size.

    ```bash
    git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/extras --depth=1
    ```

    After cloning, the scripts will be located in the `extras/simpleperf/`
    subdirectory (e.g., `./extras/simpleperf/app_profiler.py`). **Note:** This
    method provides the scripts. You will also need a compatible `simpleperf`
    binary. This binary is typically available on your Android device (if it
    supports profiling) and `app_profiler.py` will attempt to use it. Ensure any
    Python dependencies for the scripts are also met in your host environment.

2.  **Record a profile using `app_profiler.py`:** This script automates
    profiling a specific app.

    ```bash
    # Path to the simpleperf directory from your AOSP clone
    SIMPLEPERF_SCRIPT_DIR=./extras/simpleperf

    # Replace <your.app.package.name>
    python ${SIMPLEPERF_SCRIPT_DIR}/app_profiler.py \
        --app <your.app.package.name> \
        -r "-g --duration 10" \
        -o ./simpleperf_output
    ```

    - This command profiles the specified app for 10 seconds with DWARF call
      graphs (`-g`).
    - It saves `perf.data` and a `binary_cache` (for symbols) into the
      `./simpleperf_output` directory on your host machine.
    - For more details, run
      `python ${SIMPLEPERF_SCRIPT_DIR}/app_profiler.py --help` and consult the
      [Simpleperf documentation](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/extras/+/master/simpleperf/README.md).

3.  **Convert `simpleperf` data to Firefox Profiler JSON:** Use the
    `gecko_profile_generator.py` script from the same AOSP checkout.
      ```bash
      # Path to the simpleperf directory from your AOSP clone
      SIMPLEPERF_SCRIPT_DIR=./extras/simpleperf

      python ${SIMPLEPERF_SCRIPT_DIR}/gecko_profile_generator.py \
          -i ./simpleperf_output/perf.data \
          --symfs ./simpleperf_output/binary_cache \
          -o my_android_profile.json
      ```

    * This converts the `simpleperf` data, using symbols from the `binary_cache`, into the Firefox Profiler JSON format.

4. **Open this trace in ui.perfetto.dev**

    Navigate to [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev) and upload the `my_android_profile.json`
    file into the UI. Once the trace opens, you should be able select either individual
    CPU samples or ranges of time containing CPU samples to get a flamegraph of all
    the samples in that region.

    Here's an example of what that looks like

    ![](/docs/images/perf-profile-in-ui.png)

Other methods (less common for Perfetto import scenarios):

- **From Firefox Browser:** Using the built-in profiler (e.g., via
  `about:profiling` or developer tools) and saving the profile.

## Fuchsia tracing format (.fxt)

**Description:** The Fuchsia trace format (typically found in `.fxt` files) is a
binary format used by the Fuchsia operating system. It's designed for
high-performance, low-overhead recording of diagnostic information from both
userspace components and the Zircon kernel. The format features compact,
memory-aligned records and is extensible, with trace data often written directly
into Zircon Virtual Memory Objects (VMOs) for efficiency.

**Common Scenarios:** This format is primarily encountered when:

- Working with traces recorded on a Fuchsia OS device or emulator for debugging
  system behavior or analyzing performance.
- In some niche, non-Fuchsia use cases where a binary, compact, and streamable
  format with similarities to Chrome JSON's event structure is desired.
  - However, for such custom tracing needs outside of the Fuchsia ecosystem,
    generating Perfetto's
    [native TrackEvent protobuf format](/docs/reference/synthetic-track-event.md)
    is generally recommended as it is more feature-rich and better supported by
    Perfetto tools.

**Perfetto Support:**

- **Perfetto UI:** `.fxt` files can be opened directly in the Perfetto UI for
  visualization. The UI can display various Fuchsia-specific events and system
  activities.
- **Trace Processor:** Perfetto's Trace Processor supports parsing the Fuchsia
  binary format. This allows the trace data, including events, scheduling
  records, and logs, to be imported into standard Perfetto SQL tables, making it
  available for query-based analysis.

**How to Generate:**

- **On Fuchsia OS:**
  - **Using `ffx` (Fuchsia's developer tool):** The primary way to record traces
    on a Fuchsia system from a development host is using the `ffx trace start`
    command.
  - **On-target `trace` utility:** Fuchsia devices also include a `trace`
    utility that can control tracing and save trace data.
  - **Kernel-specific tracing with `ktrace`:** For Zircon kernel-level tracing,
    the `ktrace` command-line utility can be used.
- **Programmatically by custom tools:** Some projects might also generate this
  format programmatically for specific non-Fuchsia use cases, particularly if a
  binary, compact, and streamable trace format is needed.
